This repository consists of the scripts and the output that was created and produced in order to benchmark two Time Series Databases, TimescaleDB and InfluxDB,
and the paper that we wrote after the benchmarking was done, analyzing the two Time Series Databases, commenting our results and comparing those two databases.
