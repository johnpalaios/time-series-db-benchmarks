# time-series-db-benchmarks
This repository consists of the scripts and the output that was created and produced in order to benchmark two Time Series Databases, TimescaleDB and InfluxDB,
and the [paper] (https://github.com/johnpalaios/time-series-db-benchmarks/blob/main/time_series_db_comparison.pdf) that we wrote after the benchmarking was done, explaining analyzing the two Time Series Databases, how we performed the benchmarks, commenting our results and then comparing those two databases.
The .ipynb file for plot creation is also included.
